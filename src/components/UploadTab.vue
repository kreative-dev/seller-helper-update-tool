        Upload a default Warhead export with Seller Helper products on it. This
        can be done by going to Dashboard > Store > Products, and clicking the
        Export button at the top of the page. Leave the options as they are, and
        then click Export. This will download a spreadsheet of all of the
        products, which can then be uploaded below.
